#Summary statistics file information

This file contains the per-SNP p-value, associated effect on the phenotyope (odds ratio/beta values) among other data. This raw file has to be formatted processed by PRS-CS

Keep in mind that summary statistic files come from published articles. Although highly recommended, summary statistics data is not always publicly available. There is no standard format to report summary statistica, so we'll have to consider each file's particularities.

Useful repositories to obtain GWAS summary statistics:
- GWAS catalog: https://www.ebi.ac.uk/gwas/
- Psychiatric Genetics Consorium: https://pgc.unc.edu/for-researchers/download-results/
- Genetic Investigation of ANthropometric Traits consortium: https://portals.broadinstitute.org/collaboration/giant/index.php/GIANT_consortium_data_files

Summarizing, we'll need the following data from the summary statistics file:
- SNP id: with rs code
- Minor Allele Frequency: to exclude MAF<0.01. If missing, we can estimate MAFs with a reference file
- OR/beta: effect value for dichotomic/continuous phonotypes

Additionally, we'll need extra information for PRS-CS prcessing:
- Sample size: found in the article text
  - For the dichotomic phenotypes GWAS, we have to calculate the effective sample size (Neff, as proposed in https://www.biorxiv.org/content/10.1101/2021.03.29.437510v4.full)
  NEFF=(4/(2*Freq*(1-Freq)*IMPINFO)-BETA^2)/SE^2 #it makes no difference to use freq or MAF, since 2*Freq*(1-Freq) = 2*MAF*(1-MAF)
- reference linkage desequilibrium data: we'll use the UK BioBank population as reference
